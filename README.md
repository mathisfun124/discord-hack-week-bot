# discord-hack-week-bot
Small bot that takes use of https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow to make bad fan fiction.

It uses a Neural Network model to create text that tries to imitate Reki Kawahara's Light Novel titled Sword Art Online.  It was created for me to see how neural networks can be combined with a discord bot.  

The bot is probably as useful as Aqua and the fact that the model was made implies that I had to get a copy of Sword Art Online Light Novels as training data.  I used the three progressive books and the main series up to and including book 12 (which was about where the anime was at this time).
