# discord-hack-week-bot
Small bot that takes use of https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow to make bad fan fiction.

It uses a Neural Network model to create text that tries to imitate Reki Kawahara's Light Novel titled Sword Art Online.  It was created for me to see how neural networks can be combined with a discord bot.
